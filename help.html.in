CONTENT

<h1>Swine help</h1>
<p>When software does not run, this is in nearly all cases not a problem with Swine but either with wine or your wine setup. The wine AppDB contains an extensive list of Windows software that does or does not run in wine together with hints on how to make it run if possible.
<p>Swine bugs (e.g. Swine errors or Windows software that runs in wine but not in Swine) can be reported using the project issue tracker. The Swine wiki will also be filled with useful information on Swine usage and tips and tricks for running and managing software using it.</p>
