winresdump, windows ne/pe resource dumper
=========================================

Purpose
-------
winresdump (windows resource dumper) is a little utility I threw together to
get a dump of the resources in windows ne and pe executables.  ne are the 16
bit win 3.1 executables, pe are the 32bit ones.

usage: winresdump something.exe

For any dib/icon and curson graphics it comes across embedded in the ne
resources it will create image*.bmp files from them by prepending a bmp header
and dumping them out to file.

Compiling
---------
Compiling should be trivial, and should work on just about any platform.
i.e.

 gcc -o winresdump *.c -lm

Notes
-----
As always ico and cur graphics have the height field twice their actual height,
so this is halved before dumping.

I only tested it on *one* ne file, and on whatever pe files were on my sad
little windows partition but this is sort of a handy utility that might be of
use to someone.

Helping
-------

Here are some potential projects to extend this for someone.

 1. Take a windows binary and extract the menus and dialog information
if it exists in the .exe, parse and convert that into gtk or someother X widget
equivalent. While you don't get a unix clone of the app automatically at least
you get a lot of the grunt work of determining what is in the menus and
dialogs. And making gtk equivalents automatically makes a port of an
existing windows app that much faster.
The included dlgtogtk program is a sort of start on this, but its really ultra
alpha.

 2. Make a library out of this with the same functionality and similiar 
interface to the microsoft pefile library as documented in the doc 
subdirectory.
